# Bajaj Auto Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Bajaj Auto's sales data. The analysis was performed using a combination of tools and techniques, including **Excel**, **Pandas**, and **NumPy** for data preprocessing and analysis. Additionally, trends were visualized using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**, and interactive dashboards were created in **Power BI** to deliver actionable insights.

## Objectives
1. Analyze Bajaj Auto's sales performance across various dimensions.
2. Identify:
   - Top-performing models
   - Regional demand patterns
   - Customer preferences
3. Deliver actionable insights to optimize marketing strategies and boost sales.
